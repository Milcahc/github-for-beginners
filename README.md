# GitHub for Beginners: How to open source your python project

In this talk, we'll cover how to use git at the command line level to unleash the full power of git as a version control for your codebase. 

This tutorial assumes you have a basic knowledge of the command line, the git package installed (brew install git; yum install git; apt-get install git), 

## Key Concepts & Verbiage

There are many terms and concepts that the savvy git user knows but to start your git career you only need to know two primary concepts: *commits* and *repositories*.

### Commit

A commit is the act of creating a snapshot of the current state of your code. 

 - used as a verb/noun: "I just committed some code", "Check out the latest commit"
 - essentially a project is a collection of commits
 - sometimes colloquially referred to as "changes"


### Repositories (often shortened to "repo")

The directory where you access your project, its files, and all the version of its files (*commits*).  

 - Repositories can live both on your local machine and on remote servers (GitHub)
 - The act of copying a repository from a remote server to your local machine is called *cloning*.
 - Downloading commits that don't exist on your local machine from a remote repository is called *pulling* changes.
 - Uploading commits that you have on your local machine to a remote repository is called *pushing* changes.
 - Think of the remote repository (GitHub) like DropBox... it synchronizes commits accross all local machines.
