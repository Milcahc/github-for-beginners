# GitHub for Beginners: How to open source your python project

In this talk, we'll cover how to use git at the command line level to unleash the full power of git as a version control for your codebase. This tutorial assumes you have a basic knowledge of the command line, the git package installed (brew install git; yum install git; apt-get install git), and a desire to learn new things.

## Key Concepts & Verbiage

There are many terms and concepts that the savvy git user knows but to start your git career you only need to know two primary concepts: **commits** and **repositories**.

### Commit

A commit is the act of creating a snapshot of the current state of your code. 

 - used as a verb/noun: "I just committed some code", "Check out the latest commit"
 - essentially a project is a collection of commits
 - sometimes colloquially referred to as "changes"


### Repositories (often shortened to "repo")

The directory where you access your project, its files, and all the version of its files (*commits*).  

 - Repositories can live both on your local machine and on remote servers (GitHub)
 - The act of copying a repository from a remote server to your local machine is called **clone**-ing.
 - Downloading commits that don't exist on your local machine from a remote repository is called **pull**ing changes.
 - Uploading commits that you have on your local machine to a remote repository is called **push**ing changes.
 - Think of the remote repository (GitHub) like DropBox... it synchronizes commits accross all local machines.

If these terms are still confusing to you, don't worry about it. The best way to learn something is to just do it. Let's get our hands dirty...
